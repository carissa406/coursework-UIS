## CSC 302 - Discrete Structures

<details open>

1. The user inputs a number. The code creates an array list of random numbers up to the user input. The code then prints the sum and product of those integers.

2. The user inputs their number grade. The code prints the letter grade associated with their number.

3. The user inputs an integer that will be the number of rows/columns of two random matricies. The code prints out matrix A and B then prints the product of A and B.
