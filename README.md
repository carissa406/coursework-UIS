## CSC 302 - Discrete Structures

1. The user inputs a number. The code creates an array list of random numbers up to the user input. The code then prints the sum and product of those integers.

2. The user inputs their number grade. The code prints the letter grade associated with their number.

3. The user inputs an integer that will be the number of rows/columns of two random matricies. The code prints out matrix A and B then prints the product of A and B.

4. The user inputs a True or False value for x and y. The code prints the results of all logic operators on x and y.

8. Prompts the user to enter in the total number of students and their scores and then displays their letter grade based on the best score in the classroom.

    [Link to Program 8](https://github.com/carissa406/Java-1/blob/master/Grades.java)

9. Prompts the user to enter a list and then display wether it is sorted or not.
